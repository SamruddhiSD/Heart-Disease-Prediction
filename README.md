# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on
all irrespective of any status. 
Dataset information-
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a
subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been
used by ML researchers to this date. The “goal” field refers to the presence of heart
disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Attribute
Information:> 1. age> 2. sex> 3. chest pain type (4 values)> 4. resting blood pressure>
5. serum cholesterol in mg/dl> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl> 7. resting
electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)> 8. maximum heart rate achieved> 9.
exercise induced angina> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to
rest> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment> 12. number of major vessels (0-3)
colored by flourosopy> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect

The aim is to analyze this health and medical data to identify significant contributors to a possible heart disease in future and come up with solutions to avoid the behaviours  leading to a heart disease for  a future preparation.


Feature engineering performed on raw dataset. Relationship between features was studied using various graphs and plots in Tableau. The aim was to find potential contributors to a heart disease. Dashboard was prepared analyzing the various features using Tableau and final conclusions were made. Above project documents consist of High level document(HLD), Low level document(LLD), Wireframe, Architecture, Detailed Project Report (DPR) which were prepared for this Business Intelligence project based on Heart disease analysis project
along with a tableau dashboard.
